    <H5 style="color:mediumvioletred">What is a design portfolio?</H5>
    <h6 style="font-family:verdana">Building a design portfolio that accurately reflects your experiences and abilities is critical to landing a role that fits your skillset.</h6>
    
    <H5 style="color:mediumvioletred;">Why do we keep one?</H5>
    <h6 style="font-family:verdana">We keep a design portfolio to track our ideas, decisions, and progress, showing how we solve problems and build projects step by step.</h6>
    

     <h2 style="color:hotpink" id="twine">Twine Interactive Fiction</h2>
     <h6 style="font-family:verdana">It is August 26, 2038. You wake up to find an empty and silent home. Both of your parents have recently passed away and you have no siblings. (text-colour:blue)[You are completly alone.] The only thing your parents left for you was an old dusty boat from the year 2024. It is much harder to drive and the navigation system hasn't been updated in about 3 years. You decide that learning how to drive the boat will keep the memory of your father alive. So, you start your journey by going to the marina where he kept it. 

As you are approaching the boat, one of the maintence workers warns you that everytime he cleans the boat weird and odd things happen, like it starts (text-colour:blue)[thundering] or (text-colour:blue)[sharks] will appear under the dock. You decide to brush it off because you realize it was most likely just a coincidence. 

So, you take the keys and drive off. You find yourself about 50 miles from shore and are slowly running out of fuel. You notice a small note left in the cup holder next to the stearing wheel reading (text-colour:blue)["Future me DO NOT FORGET, fuel is low, storm radar stopped working, and radio stopped working"] You begin to realize your dad left this on the boat and you probably shouldv'e checked all these things before you began. 

Well, now your boat has ran out of fuel, you are 40 miles of shore, the radio doesnt work, and you see a big grey cloud approaching. 

You begin to look around you in cabinets and you find keys, food, and a small cabin.  </h6>
